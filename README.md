# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using Swing for the GUI. The project consists of two main files: `TicTacToeLogic.java` for the game logic and `TicTacToeGUI.java` for the graphical user interface.

## Files

1. **TicTacToeLogic.java**: Contains the logic for the Tic Tac Toe game including methods to initialize the board, place marks, check for a win or a tie, and switch players.
2. **TicTacToeGUI.java**: Implements the graphical user interface using Swing. This file creates the game window, handles button clicks, and updates the display based on the game state.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the files**:

   ```sh
   javac TicTacToeLogic.java
   javac TicTacToeGUI.java
   ```
2. **Run the game**:

   ```sh
   java TicTacToeGUI
   ```

## Gameplay

- The game starts with Player X.
- Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their mark (X or O) on the board.
- The game checks for a win or a tie after each move.
- If a player wins or the game is a tie, a message is displayed, and the board is reset for a new game.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- Basic knowledge of Java and Swing.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
